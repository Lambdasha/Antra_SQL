FROM dbo.Customers c
WHERE c.City NOT IN
(SELECT DISTINCT e.City
FROM dbo.Employees e)

SELECT DISTINCT c.City
FROM dbo.Customers c LEFT JOIN dbo.Employees e ON c.city = e.city
WHERE e.EmployeeID IS NULL

--3. List all products and their total order quantities throughout all orders.
SELECT p.ProductID, p.ProductName, SUM(od.Quantity) AS TotalQuantity
FROM dbo.Products p JOIN dbo.[Order Details] od ON p.ProductID = od.ProductID
GROUP BY p.ProductID, p.ProductName

--4. List all Customer Cities and total products ordered by that city.
SELECT c.City, Count(od.ProductID) AS TotalProducts
FROM dbo.Customers c JOIN dbo.Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
JOIN dbo.[Order Details] od ON o.OrderID = od.OrderID
GROUP BY c.City

--5. List all Customer Cities that have at least two customers.
SELECT c.City, COUNT(c.CustomerID) AS NumberOfCustomers
FROM dbo.Customers c
GROUP BY c.city
HAVING COUNT(c.CustomerID) >= 2

--6. List all Customer Cities that have ordered at least two different kinds of products.
SELECT c.City, COUNT(DISTINCT od.ProductID) AS NumberOfDifferentProducts
FROM dbo.Customers c JOIN dbo.Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
JOIN dbo.[Order Details] od ON o.OrderID = od.OrderID
GROUP BY c.city
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT od.ProductID) >= 2

--7. List all Customers who have ordered products, but have the ‘ship city’ on the order different from their own customer cities.
SELECT DISTINCT c.CustomerID
FROM dbo.Customers c JOIN dbo.Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
WHERE c.City != o.ShipCity

--8. List 5 most popular products, their average price, and the customer city that ordered most quantity of it.
SELECT TOP(5) p.ProductID, p.ProductName, SUM(od.Quantity) AS TotalQuantity,
AVG(od.UnitPrice) AS AveragePrice,

SELECT c.City, p.ProductID, MAX(SUM(od.Quantity))
FROM dbo.Customers c JOIN dbo.Orders o ON o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
JOIN dbo.[Order Details] od ON od.OrderID = o.OrderID
JOIN dbo.Products p ON p.ProductID = od.ProductID
GROUP BY c.City, p.ProductID
ORDER BY p.ProductID

FROM dbo.Products p JOIN dbo.[Order Details] od ON p.ProductID = od.ProductID
JOIN dbo.Orders o ON o.OrderID = od.OrderID
JOIN dbo.Customers c ON o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
GROUP BY p.ProductID, p.ProductName
ORDER BY SUM(od.Quantity) DESC

SELECT c.City, p.ProductID, SUM(od.Quantity)
FROM dbo.Customers c JOIN dbo.Orders o ON o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
JOIN dbo.[Order Details] od ON od.OrderID = o.OrderID
JOIN dbo.Products p ON p.ProductID = od.ProductID
GROUP BY c.City, p.ProductID

--9. List all cities that have never ordered something but we have employees there.

--a. Use sub-query

--b. Do not use sub-query

--10. List one city, if exists, that is the city from where the employee sold most orders (not the product quantity) is, and also the city of most total quantity of products ordered from. (tip: join  sub-query)

--11. How do you remove the duplicates record of a table?
